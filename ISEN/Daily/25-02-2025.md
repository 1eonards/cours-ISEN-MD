### Text en vrac
In the rapidly evolving field of healthcare, robotics has emerged as a transformative force, bridging the gap between prosthetics and artificial organs. These advancements represent significant leaps forward in improving the quality of life for individuals with limb differences and organ failure.

Robotic prosthetics, such as myoelectric hand prostheses, exemplify the fusion of technology and healthcare. These devices are designed to mimic the natural movements of the human hand, offering users unprecedented levels of dexterity and control. By utilizing electrical signals from muscles, these prosthetics enable intuitive and precise movements. This technology allows users to perform daily tasks with greater ease and confidence, from grasping objects to executing intricate tasks that were previously challenging or impossible.

The integration of robotics in prosthetics not only enhances functionality but also addresses the emotional and psychological aspects of limb loss. Customizable and lifelike in appearance, these prosthetics help users regain a sense of normalcy and independence. Moreover, ongoing advancements in materials science and artificial intelligence promise even more sophisticated and responsive prosthetics in the future.

In addition to prosthetics, artificial organs powered by robotics and bioengineering are revolutionizing organ replacement and support therapies. These innovative devices aim to replicate the functions of vital organs such as the heart, kidneys, and pancreas. For instance, ventricular assist devices (VADs) support heart function in patients with heart failure by helping the heart pump blood, while artificial pancreas systems automate insulin delivery for individuals with diabetes, mimicking the natural function of the pancreas.

The development of artificial organs addresses the critical shortage of donor organs and offers long-term solutions for chronic conditions. Researchers are continually exploring new materials and technologies to create more durable and biocompatible organs, enhancing patient outcomes and quality of life.
