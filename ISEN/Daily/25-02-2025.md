### Text en vrac
In the rapidly evolving field of healthcare, robotics has emerged as a transformative force, bridging the gap between prosthesis and artificial organs. These advancements represent significant leaps forward in improving the quality of life for individuals with limb differences and organ failure.

Robotic prostheses, such as myoelectric hand prosthesis, exemplify the fusion of technology and healthcare. These devices are designed to mimic the natural movements of human hand, offering users unprecedented levels of dexterity and control. By utilizing myoelectric signals, the electrical impulses generated by muscle contractions, these prostheses enable intuitive and precise movements. This technology allows users to perform daily tasks with geater ease and confidence, from grasping objects to executing intricate tasks that were previously challen
