# Post
ðŸŽ‰ This year I have started a new adventure: studying through a work-study program at ISEN Nantes!

Itâ€™s a unique opportunity to blend learning with hands-on experience, and Iâ€™m thrilled to share more about it!

ðŸ’¼ Iâ€™m currently working at **Horoquartz**, in the R&D department in Nantes. The company has been fantastic, offering a supportive and enriching environment. Starting my first real job (beyond summer roles) was definitely nerve-wracking at first, but thanks to the warm welcome and encouragement from the team, I quickly felt at ease.

ðŸ’¡I had the opportunity to conduct a language benchmark for one of our projects. It was an incredibly interesting experience, allowing me to explore and evaluate the best language for this application. It has allowed me to be discover some new tools that I could maybe use in the futur.

ðŸŒŸA big thank you to **Horoquartz** for their trust and to **ISEN Nantes** for supporting me on this dual journey. Iâ€™m eager to keep growing and contributing to meaningful projects.
