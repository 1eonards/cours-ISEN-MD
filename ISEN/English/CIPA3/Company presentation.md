Our company is Horoquartz, **a** computer service company **specializing in** Human **Resources.**

The company was founded in 1971 **in Fontenay-le-Comte** and was **acquired** in 2008 by the Japanese **company** Amano, a Japanese leader in time management, parking systems, and workforce solutions.  
Initially focused on time-tracking solutions, Horoquartz has since expanded its expertise to include workforce management, becoming a leader in its field.

Today, Horoquartz **has** more than **650 employees** in **16 locations**, mainly in France, **in cities such as** Fontenay-le-Comte, Nantes, Lyon, **and** Massy.  
Even **though** Horoquartz is mainly **based** in France, it **serves** more than 5,000 customers in 30 countries, **including** Ferrero, **the National Directorate of Armament**, Alstom, Cdiscount, **and others**.  
The main product is called eTemptation; **it is** a time-tracking and activity-tracking software. **The company** also offers a security **application** called ProtecSys2.

We have a pretty simple work policy, **which includes** flex time: **we only need to work seven hours per day or 35 hours per week.** We also work in an open space **but with dedicated offices. Occasional remote work is also allowed.**

Our team is composed of **three people:** Antony, our manager, **and the two of us.**  
Our mission for **the next three years** is pretty simple: we have to create an update system for eTemptation. **It's a very challenging task, as** a big part of the code is older than us.
