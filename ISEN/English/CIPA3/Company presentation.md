The main product is called eTemptation, this is a time tracking and activity tracking software. They also have a security Application called ProtecSys2.

We have a pretty simple work policy, with include flex time, we only need to work 7 hours per day or 35 hours a week. We also work in an open space but with a dedicated office, but we also have occasional remote-work allowed.

Our team is composed of 3 peoples, Antony our manager and us 2. Our mission for 3 year is pretty simple, we have to create an update system for eTemptation, it's a very challenging mission because a big part of the code is older than us.
