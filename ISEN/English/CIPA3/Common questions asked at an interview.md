# Tell me about yourself.
I am FÃ©lix Marquet, 21-year-old. I has been passionate about IT and Cybersecurity for the past decade. Over the years, I have undertaken various projects, both in engineering school and independently, which have allowed me to cultivate a self-taught approach to learning. Currently, I am in my third year at ISEN Nantes, pursuing an engineering degree, and I have been undertaking an apprenticeship at Horoquartz since September 2024.
