# Tell me about yourself.
I am FÃ©lix Marquet, 21-year-old. I has been passionate about IT and Cybersecurity for the past decade. Over the years, I have undertaken various projects, both in engineering school and independently, which have allowed me to cultivate a self-taught approach to learning. Currently, I am in my third year at ISEN Nantes, pursuing an engineering degree, and I have been undertaking an apprenticeship at Horoquartz since September 2024.

# What motivates you ?
(Context: Trying to work for Cloud Imperium Games)
My motivation to join Cloud Imperium Games comes from a combination of my long-standing passion for IT and cybersecurity and my enthusiasm for the innovative work being done on Star Citizen. Having played Star Citizen myself, I am genuinely excited about the opportunity to contribute to a project that is pushing the boundaries of what's possible in gaming. This role is particularly appealing to me because it aligns perfectly with my technical skills and my eagerness to work in a creative and challenging environment.

I am especially drawn to the prospect of working in an international setting, which I believe will not only enhance my professional skills but also allow me to grow personally by improving my language abilities and adapting to new cultural experiences. I am eager to bring my background in engineering and my self-taught expertise to your team, and I am confident that my proactive approach to learning and problem-solving will make me a valuable addition to Cloud Imperium Games.

# How do you handle constructive criticism or feedback ?
When I receive constructive criticism or feedback, I see it as a valuable opportunity to grow and improve. I listen carefully to understand the points being made and ask questions if I need clarification. This helps me reflect on my work and identify areas where I can make positive changes. I believe that embracing feedback is essential for professional development and demonstrates my commitment to continuous learning.
